# defect-detection
Implementation of Automated Defect Detection System with Deep Learning.
The objectives of this project are

 1. to evaluate several deep learning architectures over manufacturing defect datasets
 2. to integrate the detection pipeline with [Cytomine](https://cytomine.coop/), an open-source web platform which fosters collaborative analysis of very large images and allows semi-automatic processing of large image collections via machine learning algorithms.

The works is currently heavily based on [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), a deep learning-based detection framework developed by [Facebook](https://ai.facebook.com/research/), and powered by Pytorch.
